This is an ***unofficial*** iCIMS TSE companion extension for Google Chrome.

## What does this offer?
In the current version, this is mainly used for quick links to some of the most accessed articles on the Care site. These are common articles that are pulled for cases most often. I put them in an extension to make it easy to access.

## How to install
Installation is really easy.
1. Download the repo under releases
2. Unzip into a folder
3. In Chrome, navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
4. Turn Developer Mode on by selecting the toggle on the top right
5. Press the newly added Load Unpacked button
6. Select the unzipped folder

## What's planned for the future
I am working on adding greater customizability and some Javascript functionality to automate platform tasks.
